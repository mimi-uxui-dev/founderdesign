  "f1": "Isn't hiring a full-time designer better?",
  "f2": "Well, well, well, you've got quite the curious mind! Let me enlighten you with some amusing insights. Firstly, let's talk numbers. Hiring a full-time senior-level designer will cost you a pretty penny, over $100,000 annually, and let's not forget those lovely benefits they demand. Oh, and good luck finding one available in the first place! But here's the kicker: What if you don't always have enough work to keep them occupied? You'd be stuck paying for their idle time, my friend. Ouch! Now, brace yourself for a delightful alternative. With our monthly plan, you have the power to play the game of pausing and resuming your subscription whenever it tickles your fancy. This means you only pay your designer when you actually have work for them. Clever, right? It's like having a magical button to control your designer's time and your expenses. Genius!",

  "f13": "What is the expected turnaround time for receiving my designs?",
  "f14": "Most requests are done within two days or less, but complex ones may take longer.",
